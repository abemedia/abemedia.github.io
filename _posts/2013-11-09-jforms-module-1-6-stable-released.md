Save the submitted form data straight to a Google Spreadsheet!
- **Your Mailing List Plugin**  
It is now possible to sign up users to your YMLP mailing list through JForms Module.
- **Data manipulation**  
The API of JForms Module has been updated to allow plugins to manipulate the data before it gets sent.
- **Name splitting**  
JForms Module can now split full names into first & last name so the form gets pre-populated correctly with logged in users details.

Includes layouts for Bootstrap 3 as well as Bootstrap 2 now.
- **Custom JS API**  
JavaScript API to call your own functions on various form events (eg. when sent etc.). Documentation to follow.

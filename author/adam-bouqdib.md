Adam is a veteran on the open source scene providing expertise on most common CMS & e-commerce systems on the market as well as actively contributing to the open source community in his free time. 

Specialising in Joomla! back in 2007 he is the man for creating custom Joomla extensions as well as being an expert in all things front-end & user experience.

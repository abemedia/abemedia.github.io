Intergalactic Music is a UK based talent agency and live music & club night events company. Their agency manages some of the UK's finest DJs, live bands, beatboxers and vocal talent and works closely with promoters across the world.

### The Project

Intergalactic Music needed a platform to showcase their portfolio of artists and sell their event tickets. It needed to be mobile & tablet friendly, allowing their customers to purchase event tickets on the go, and make use of social media wherever possible.

ABE Media created a bespoke event listing & ticket sales ecommerce application which makes use of the Facebook Open Graph API to display who will be attending events, the Stripe JavaScript API to securely handle payments and a one-click social sign-in with Facebook & Google to simplify and streamline the purchase process.

To effectively showcase the artists we developed a system which pulls in content from numerous feeds including YouTube, SoundCloud, Facebook & Twitter and updates the profiles automatically with fresh & up-to-date content.  
We didn't stop there though and developed an image gallery which feeds from their Facebook page and a videos page which grabs their latest videos off YouTube.

The result is a socially super-charged website which is a breeze to update and renders beautifully on any device, making it probably one of the most user-friendly ticket sales websites in the UK.
